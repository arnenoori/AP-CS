// For division you must have a demical place somewhere
// More vocab: Int variables can be split into 2 parts
// 1. declaration - you declaring a ariable of type int with the name x.
// 2. declaration - you declaring a varaiable of ype int with the name x.

// The math class is called an utility class

// If there is a returned value, do somethig with it. Either store it or print
// it.

// Test - write a method that finds C given A and B (Phyties)
